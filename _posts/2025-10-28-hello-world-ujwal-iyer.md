## Hello there!

I’m **Ujwal Iyer**, a Senior Product Manager at SAP Labs, Bangalore, where I help design and scale products that reduce onboarding time and accelerate adoption.

Before I moved into product management, I spent years as a developer and solution architect, writing C#, building systems on Azure and AWS, and designing secure, scalable architectures for enterprise customers. That experience gave me a builder’s mindset - something I still rely on every day as a PM.

Today, I work at the intersection of AI, automation, and product strategy, shaping how businesses experience value from SAP’s cloud ecosystem.

## From Developer to Product Management

-  **Developer roots** - I began my career as a software engineer writing C# and .NET code, obsessed with performance, design patterns- creating trading apps, and multi-player games using Microsoft Kinect SDK and Microsoft PixelSense.  
-  **Architect years** - Over time, I grew into a Cloud Solution Architect, designing hybrid solutions on Azure, AWS, and SAP BTP, and became a Microsoft Certified Azure Solutions Architect Expert and SAP Certified BTP Solution Architect.  
-  **Product management** - For the last six years at SAP Labs India, I’ve led platform product with enterprise kubernetes SAP Gardener, data management solutions with SAP Data Intelligence, and at present building a greenfield SaaS platform that transforms customer onboarding from a months-long process into a guided, self-service experience.  
-  **Product philosophy** - My focus is on blending strong technical foundations with product vision - ensuring that “how we build” never loses sight of “why we build.”

## What You’ll Find Here

This blog isn’t about buzzwords or corporate updates - it’s my **personal lab notebook**.  
A space to share hands-on projects, product insights, and the messy middle between technology and strategy.

Each post will blend **architecture, PM thinking, code experiments, and AI** - written for product people who like to get their hands dirty. I believe there is no greater retention in learning than by building something: from idea to outcomes.

## Why I Started This Blog

We’re entering a decade where **product managers can’t just “talk tech” - they need to build with it**.  The ability to combine design, data, automation, platform, and architecture thinking will define the next generation of PMs.

This blog is my way of staying hands-on - to keep learning, to share what works (and what doesn’t), and to build a public record of experiments at the frontier of AI and product design.

## Outside Work

When I’m not experimenting with AI workflows or writing about platforms, I’m:
- building small learning projects with my 5-year-old son,  
- reading and discussing **Ramayana and Mahabharata**,  
- or helping my wife **Gayathri**, an urban designer, in her work on sustainable city projects across India.  

That balance between **technology, learning, and purpose** is what keeps me curious.
