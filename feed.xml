<p>My 5-year-old is obsessed with questions.<br />
Not the “what’s two plus two” kind - but the ones that stop you mid-scroll.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Why can’t we see air?” “Why is Hanuman red?” “Why does a gas flame burn blue, not orange like a matchstick?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Half my evenings are spent switching between ChatGPT tabs and bedtime stories. It made me wonder - if AI can answer my product strategy questions at work, why can’t it nurture his curiosity too?</p>

<p>That’s when it hit me: <em>we build AI to make adults efficient; maybe it’s time I build an AI to make kids wonder.</em></p>

<p>Before jumping into tools or frameworks, I did what any PM would do - built a persona.<br />
Not a B2B buyer or an enterprise admin, but a <strong>Curious Explorer aged five</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="3-designing-for-zero-screen-time">3. Designing for Zero Screen Time</h2>

<p>Here’s where most AI tools fail children - they assume visual attention.<br />
But for a 5-year-old, <strong>eyes are for imagination, not interfaces</strong>.</p>

<p>So, the system must rely purely on <strong>voice + presence</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Wake word model:</strong> “Hey Rama, can you tell me about rainbows?”</li>
  <li><strong>TTS engine:</strong> A friendly Indian-accented voice that blends warmth and curiosity.</li>
  <li><strong>Sound design:</strong> Each response ends with a short hum, like a “thinking” pause - helping the child know it’s listening.</li>
  <li><strong>Emotional pacing:</strong> Limit answers to 2–3 sentences. End with a “What do you think?” to spark dialogue.</li>
</ul>

<p>This isn’t a chatbot; I will try to design it like a <strong>co-explorer</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="a-guardrails">a. <strong>Guardrails</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use a <strong>local LLM (like Llama 3.1 GGUF)</strong> fine-tuned on pre-vetted content - no open internet access.</li>

<h2 id="6-the-delight-loop">6. The Delight Loop</h2>

<p>The delight moment isn’t when it answers correctly.<br />
It’s when it <strong>asks back</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Do you think Hanuman could jump because he was light like air or strong like wind?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s when a child pauses, <em>thinks</em>, and smiles. That’s engagement, not addiction.</p>

<p>That moment becomes viral - not on social media, but across living rooms. Parents talk. Builders notice. And the loop grows.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="7-my-learning-journey-as-a-product-manager">7. My Learning Journey as a Product Manager</h2>

<p>This project isn’t just for my son - it’s a sandbox for <strong>me</strong> as a product manager.</p>

<p>I’ll be learning AI by <strong>building it hands-on</strong>, using a Raspberry Pi 5 (16GB) as the playground.<br />
Here’s what I plan to implement and learn through this:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>LLM integration:</strong> Running local inference with Llama 3.1 GGUF models.</li>
  <li><strong>Agentic frameworks:</strong> Building multi-agent orchestration using <strong>LangChain</strong> and <strong>LangGraph</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Hierarchical RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):</strong> Organizing mythology, science, and nature stories in topic layers.</li>
  <li><strong>Text-to-Speech (TTS):</strong> Crafting emotionally warm, kid-friendly voice synthesis.</li>
  <li><strong>Speech-to-Text (STT):</strong> Capturing natural child speech and simplifying intent parsing.</li>
  <li><strong>Safety and moderation layer:</strong> Filtering and transforming responses for age-appropriateness.</li>
  <li><strong>Edge deployment:</strong> Running everything locally for privacy and offline reliability.</li>
  <li><strong>Voice UX testing:</strong> Observing how a child’s curiosity shapes the LLM feedback loop.</li>
</ul>

<p>So there are really <strong>three happy personas</strong> in this journey:</p>

<h2 id="8-product-managers-reflection">8. Product Manager’s Reflection</h2>

<p>This project taught me something no user research could - <strong>curiosity is the most underrated product metric</strong>.</p>

<p>In building this, I’m not launching another “AI for kids” app. I’m <strong>redesigning how curiosity scales safely</strong> in the age of LLMs.  If this works, I’ll have built not just a learning companion for my child - but a blueprint for how AI can grow <em>with</em> us, not <em>over</em> us.*</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="9-whats-next">9. What’s Next</h2>

<p>I’m building this project <strong>from scratch</strong> - hardware, data pipeline, orchestration, tools, and voice UX.<br />
The goal is simple:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>To make curiosity the most natural interface between a child and AI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Watch this space - I’ll be sharing each milestone as I build the <strong>Kid-Safe AI Companion</strong> on Raspberry Pi 5.</p>

<p>The next post in this series will cover:  Setup of Raspberry Pi 5</p>

It was the product equivalent of a breakthrough - transforming the complex world of open-weight LLMs into a single command-line experience that <em>just works</em>.</p>

<p>This product teardown explores how Ollama for Windows works, the specific technical innovations that made it possible, and what product managers can take away from its execution.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="1-why-this-launch-matters">1. Why This Launch Matters</h2>

<p>Until recently, running a model like Llama 3 or Mistral locally on Windows meant long hours of driver installs, CUDA mismatches, and dependency chaos.<br />
Ollama changed that by shipping a <strong>self-contained LLM runtime</strong> that requires no Docker, no Python, no setup.</p>

<p>By extending that simplicity to Windows - still the world’s dominant OS for developers and enterprises - Ollama unlocked a massive new user base and, in doing so, quietly shifted the local AI landscape.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="2-how-ollama-works-on-windows">2. How Ollama Works on Windows</h2>

<h3 id="a-the-runtime-core---go--llamacpp"><strong>a. The Runtime Core - Go + llama.cpp</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Ollama’s runtime is written in Go, not Python or Node.</li>
  <li>Go compiles into static binaries, bundling everything required to run locally - no external dependencies.</li>
  <li>Under the hood, Ollama uses llama.cpp, a highly optimized C++ engine that performs quantized inference directly on CPU or GPU.</li>
</ul>

<p>This combination lets users download a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.exe</code> and start running models instantly - no environment setup, no path variables, no GPU driver hunting.</p>

<p>Abstraction is adoption.
 Reducing cognitive load isn’t just good UX - it’s a growth strategy.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="b-gpu-acceleration---directml-backend"><strong>b. GPU Acceleration - DirectML Backend</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>On Windows, Ollama uses DirectML, Microsoft’s hardware-agnostic ML acceleration layer built on DirectX 12.</li>
  <li>DirectML automatically detects available GPUs - NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel - and routes compute workloads accordingly.</li>
  <li>If no compatible GPU exists, Ollama falls back gracefully to CPU inference.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Impact:</strong><br />
Every modern Windows machine becomes a viable LLM host - even without CUDA.
PM lesson: build for the majority, not the elite hardware subset.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="c-unified-model-format---gguf"><strong>c. Unified Model Format - GGUF</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Ollama standardized on GGUF, a binary format that bundles model weights, tokenizer data, and quantization metadata.</li>
  <li>The format supports memory mapping (MMAP) - only required layers are loaded into memory.</li>
  <li>This is especially critical for Windows’ NTFS, which has higher IO overhead.</li>
</ul>

<p>Result: faster model load times, smaller memory footprint, and cleaner portability.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="d-local-openai-compatible-api-layer"><strong>d. Local OpenAI-Compatible API Layer</strong></h3>

<p>One of Ollama’s smartest design moves lies in its API compatibility layer.<br />
It exposes a local HTTP server at http://localhost:11434 that mirrors the OpenAI REST API, including the most widely used route:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>POST /v1/chat/completions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This endpoint behaves identically to OpenAI’s:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Accepts model, messages[] (roles: system, user, assistant), and standard parameters like temperature, max_tokens, and stream.</li>
  <li>Streams tokens live via Server-Sent Events (SSE).</li>
  <li>Returns OpenAI-compatible JSON responses - meaning tools like LangChain, LlamaIndex, Cursor, and n8n work out-of-the-box.</li>
</ul>

<p>It also supports:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/v1/completions</code> - for text-only generation</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/v1/embeddings</code> - for RAG workflows</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/api/generate</code> - Ollama’s original simple local route</li>
</ul>

<p>To switch any app from OpenAI to Ollama, simply change the base URL:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">OPENAI_API_KEY</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"ollama"</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally test locally:</p>

<h2 id="3-setup-in-5-minutes">3. Setup in 5 Minutes</h2>

<p>I’m <strong>Ujwal Iyer</strong>, a Senior Product Manager at SAP Labs, Bangalore, where I help design and scale products that reduce onboarding time and accelerate adoption.</p>

<p>Before I moved into product management, I spent years as a developer and solution architect, writing C#, building systems on Azure and AWS, and designing secure, scalable architectures for enterprise customers. That experience gave me a builder’s mindset - something I still rely on every day as a PM.</p>

<p>Today, I work at the intersection of AI, automation, and product strategy, shaping how businesses experience value from SAP’s cloud ecosystem.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="from-developer-to-product-management">From Developer to Product Management</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Developer roots</strong> - I began my career as a software engineer writing C# and .NET code, obsessed with performance, design patterns- creating trading apps, and multi-player games using Microsoft Kinect SDK and Microsoft PixelSense.</li>
  <li><strong>Architect years</strong> - Over time, I grew into a Cloud Solution Architect, designing hybrid solutions on Azure, AWS, and SAP BTP, and became a Microsoft Certified Azure Solutions Architect Expert and SAP Certified BTP Solution Architect.</li>
  <li><strong>Product management</strong> - For the last six years at SAP Labs India, I’ve led platform product with enterprise kubernetes SAP Gardener, data management solutions with SAP Data Intelligence, and at present building a greenfield SaaS platform that transforms customer onboarding from a months-long process into a guided, self-service experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Product philosophy</strong> - My focus is on blending strong technical foundations with product vision - ensuring that “how we build” never loses sight of “why we build.”</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-youll-find-here">What You’ll Find Here</h2>

<p>This blog isn’t about buzzwords or corporate updates - it’s my <strong>personal lab notebook</strong>.<br />
A space to share hands-on projects, product insights, and the messy middle between technology and strategy.</p>

<p>Each post will blend <strong>architecture, PM thinking, code experiments, and AI</strong> - written for product people who like to get their hands dirty. I believe there is no greater retention in learning than by building something: from idea to outcomes.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="why-i-started-this-blog">Why I Started This Blog</h2>

<p>We’re entering a decade where <strong>product managers can’t just “talk tech” - they need to build with it</strong>.  The ability to combine design, data, automation, platform, and architecture thinking will define the next generation of PMs.</p>

<p>This blog is my way of staying hands-on - to keep learning, to share what works (and what doesn’t), and to build a public record of experiments at the frontier of AI and product design.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="outside-work">Outside Work</h2>

<p>When I’m not experimenting with AI workflows or writing about platforms, I’m:</p>
